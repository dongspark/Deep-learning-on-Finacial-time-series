# Deep-learning on Finacial time series analysis --Stock price prediction of Google/Microsoft/Amazon
This project investigates time series forecasting problems in finance, precisely the stock price prediction problem. It employ and compare traditional statistical algorithms like MA, ARIMA, and ARMA- GARCH with newly developed deep learning-based algorithms such RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, TCNs, and bidirectional LSTMs and GRUs for predicting stock prices. We perform a comprehensive study and present all the experimental results on different datasets. We find that ARIMA and GRU perform better for single-step stock price prediction than other deep learning architectures. Adding market and economic indicators do not improve the performance of the deep learning models.
